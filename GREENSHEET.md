Course Description
------------------
Experimental applications in physical computing in art and object oriented programming. Topics include computer-controlled sensors and actuators, the nature of the cyborg and interactive electronic interfaces for sculpture, environments and performance. Course is repeatable up to 6 units, when course topic changes. Prerequisites: ART 75 and ART 101 or permission of instructor. Misc/Lab: Activity 6 hours.


Course Goals
-------------
Gain proficiency in Max/MSP programming environment. Learn basic concepts and techniques of computer- based music, composition, and performance. Included will be the exposure to the essentials of digital audio signal processing, musical acoustics and psychoacoustics, sound analysis and synthesis, software tools created by the Center for New Music and Audio Technologies (CNMAT), and use of Open Sound Control (OSC) and the language odot.
Begin to make your own art with these tools.  Possibly begin to work towards advanced projects using these tools.



Learning Outcomes
-----------------

###### LO1: Create professional level artwork that demonstrates conceptual depth and technical craftsmanship. 
###### LO2: Develop criteria for evaluating how to design and produce interactive digital media. 
###### LO3: Identify the broad trends of interactive digital media and its aesthetics. 
###### LO4: Plan and practice writing simple programs in a several different programming languages/authoring systems.
###### LO5: Articulate and recite introductory programming concepts related to artist making code in different programming languages/frameworks like Max/MSP.

Required Texts/Textbook
--------
No required textbook. Readings will be available on Canvas in pdf format.


Classroom Protocol
==================
We may discuss controversial issues, difficult subjects, and matters that are personally important to someone in the class. We will work together to craft group agreements (code of conduct) outlining our agreed-upon guidelines for creating a respectful class environment. It is expected that students will act in accordance with group agreements for the remainder of the semester. 


Participation
-------------
Participation in class discussions, critique, and giving feedback to your peers on their work is mandatory.
On Presentation days you must be able to explain and give a clear presentation of your work.
Students are expected to participate in discussion and peer support in the class Discord server.
Other Policies


Grading Policy
--------------

Success in this course is based on the expectation that students will spend, for each unit of credit, a minimum of 45 hours over the length of the course (normally three hours per unit per week) for instruction, preparation/studying, or course related activities, including but not limited to internships, labs, and clinical practica. Other course structures will have equivalent workload expectations as described in the syllabus.

This course will be following a flipped classroom model for learning. Activities traditionally expected in the classroom v. homework will be flipped. You are expected to watch video tutorials outside of class. Class will focus on lab time to complete assignments (traditionally thought of as “homework”). Class will also be used for discussion of artists and readings, active learning exercises, review, quizes, and challenges.  This optimizes time for peer and instructor support (a great way to minimize frustration while learning to code). All shorter assignments can be completed in class. Culminating projects for each node might require work outside of class. Video tutorials will be relatively short. Students will be expected to code along with the video: the code itself will not be provided.
