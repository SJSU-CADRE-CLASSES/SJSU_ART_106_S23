        <h4>Exercise 1</h4>
        <p>
          For the first complex pattern, I chose this picture because it was extremely simple and reminded me of a parking lot that is packed full of cars. For the 2nd complex pattern, I chose this one because it was a lot like what one would see underneath a microscope. The first tesselation pattern was very striking to me and made a really interesting pattern. For the 2nd tesselatino pattern, I thought it was interesting because it kind of looks like the same pattern you would see on a quilt.

          <h4>Exercise 2</h4>
          <p>I think the possibilities of modular origami is amazing as it’s almost endless while using such a simple shape. I saw people creat simple animals to dragons and other crazy creatures. My group had issues creating a comlex piece because we were not able to meet up together a lot and we were both extremely busy. Our final product was, in my head, a fantasy world stickbug like creature. Unfortunately, a lot of my pieces were not used as we could not attach them in time. My pieces were the yellow and blue ones.</p>

       <h4>Exercise 3</h4>
      <p>As my group was made of only 2 people, we were luckily enough to not have to worry about having too many shapes with the same side. Our common shape ended up being a wave like one as it was very simple but still allowed for interesting possibilities. For myself, a problem I had was making the shape interesting, but I like to think I succeeded in that. I wish I had went with a different shape because I wanted to be able to flip the triangles more ways and have them still connect. When we combined shapes, mine kept ending up in a circular form. The limitations of my partner and I choosing to go with a triangle as the base shape was that it wouldn’t be able to spread out as much as we wanted.</p>

      <h2>Exercise 4</h2>
<p>For this exercise, I was moved to a new group so I had to make last minute changes. The shape I made for this used 2 stars and allowed them to be moved around more (like how I wanted for my last tesselation). When my group combined, we had to combine 5 peoples shapes so it became a little difficult to find a spot to placement our shape. In the end, we succeeded and were able to combine everyone’s shapes. Although we had a lot of people, we were able to troubleshoot our problems and fix them.</p>

          <p>For this exercise, I wanted to go with a Dovetail lock with key. This kind of fastener was really interesting to me because of the possible keys that would be made to keep the wood together. For my piece, I went with an hourglass shape, with a circular middle as opposed to the 2 large bulbs in normal hourglasses. This fastener would be good for puzzles, but not really much else. Although the shape keeps the wood held together, the fastener/key would break under a lot of pressure (if it was not 2D). </p>

            <p>For this exercise, I used simple rectangles with larger or smaller ends in order to find a shape that keeps it together better. This fastener worked out pretty well but there are better alternatives. I could not get pictures but we did have multiple variations. </p>

In the end we decided that we should go with a slotting joint as that ended up being a good fit for our theme. My group and I decided to make it an “anthropological adventure”. The goal of our kit is to reconstruct a prehistoric monster. There are multiple variations of heads, fins, ribs, spines, tails, etc. Each member of the group was given the goal of creating those body part variations. Each time the person would open the kit, they would be able to make a different animal.
