         <h5> Part 1</h5>
		<p><li>What is a good working definition of what a System is and perhaps what it is not? </li></p> 
      <p> A system is a group of components that work together or interact with one another in order to maintain themselves.</p>
        
    <p><li>For the 4 system definations you were to look up please give in your own words what they mean and give an example of them for each case.</li></p> 
      <p> 
        <strong>Modularity -</strong> You could move components somewhere else, and they could still do their original purpose
        <br>
        <strong>Decomposibility -</strong> The point where something can no longer be broken down without removing the things purpose.
        <br>
        <strong>Emergence -</strong> Complex patterns coming from a group (ex, flocks of birds flying, snowflakes falling)
        <br>
        <strong>Chaos Theory -</strong> A small cause could cause a large effect (butterfly effect). Ex. 1 person slowing on a highway can cause a traffic jam

      </p> 

    <p><li>What is the difference between ideas of Modularity and Tesselation? What are the properties that are in oppostion with each other?</li></p> 
      <p> Modularity has a purpose and effect whereas the tesselation is the result of repeating geometric shapes. </p>  

    <p><li>What is the difference between designing something that has Complexity (aperiodic) vs being Uniform (periodic)</li></p> 
      <p> When something is uniform, something happens X times every X (ex. every 3 squares is a triangle). A consistent pattern with regular intervals</p>
      <p>When something is complex, something does NOT have to happen every X. Has patterns that cannot be easily predicted</p> 
        
    <p><li>What is the difference between a system diagram and a some kind of feature diagram like a exploded view drawing or a illustration like this lady bug. Please explain in complete sentances</li></p>
      <p> An exploded view is like reverse engineering something where the parts come apart, the something is fully made. </p>
      <p> A system diagram shows how the parts of the system work or interact together.</p>

       <a href="images/decomp.png" > <img src="images/decomp.png" class="u-full-width"/> This image is for decomposition. It is decomposition because, the diagram does not go into extreme or unnecessary detail about each part of the system.</a>

     <div class="six columns">    
       
         <a href="images/modular.png" > <img src="images/modular.png" class="u-full-width"/> This image is for modularity. The image shows a diagram of a DJ setup which includes screens, and other tech the dj uses for making music and streaming online. It is modular because each of the pieces of the system are interchangeable and can be put on any side.</a>

       <a href="images/emergence.png" > <img src="images/emergence.png" class="u-full-width"/> This image is for emergence. The image is of the process that ants use when they find food and alert other ants to bring the food back to the colony. It is emergence because one ant starts doing their routine, then the other ants start doing the same causing a line of ants bringing back food.   </a>

         <a href="images/chaos theory.png" > <img src="images/chaos theory.png" class="u-full-width"/> This image is for chaos theory. It depicts the many ways weather can change and the results of those changes. It is chaos theory because one (potentially) small change at the start could cause a massive difference in the end. </a>
